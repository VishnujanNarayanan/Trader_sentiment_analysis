# Trader Sentiment Analysis Based on Fear & Greed Index

## üß† Project Summary

This project analyzes trader behavior under varying market sentiment using the **Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index** as a sentiment indicator. It explores how emotions‚Äîfear and greed‚Äîaffect trading patterns, profitability, and volumes. By comparing trade statistics across sentiments, the analysis validates the behavioral finance theory that emotions drive trading behavior and performance.

## Objective

This project explores the relationship between trader performance and Bitcoin market sentiment using two primary datasets:

1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset** ‚Äî containing daily Fear & Greed classifications.
2. **Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid** ‚Äî detailed trade-level data including execution price, size, side, closed PnL, leverage, and more.

The goal is to uncover hidden patterns and insights that link trader behavior to market sentiment. These insights aim to support smarter trading strategies by validating how market emotions such as fear and greed influence profitability in cryptocurrency trading.

By analyzing these datasets, this project provides a data-driven approach to improve decision-making and performance in the volatile Web3 trading landscape.

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted in the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**  
   - Imported the Bitcoin Market Sentiment dataset and Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid.
   - [üìä Historical Trade Data (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IAfLZwu6rJzyWKgBToqwSmmVYU6VbjVs/view?usp=sharing)
   - [üß≠ Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PgQC0tO8XN-wqkNyghWc_-mnrYv_nhSf/view?usp=sharing)
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the trade data by handling missing values, formatting timestamps, and standardizing categorical variables like trade side and sentiment labels.

2. **Data Integration**  
   - Merged the trader data with the sentiment dataset based on date to align each trade with the corresponding Fear & Greed Index classification.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Examined trade distributions across different sentiment categories.  
   - Calculated summary statistics such as total trade volume, trade counts, and average profit and loss (PnL) for buy and sell sides under various market sentiments.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Created heatmaps and line plots to visualize the relationship between trade performance and sentiment categories.  
   - Visualized PnL differences between buy and sell trades across sentiment levels to highlight key patterns.

5. **Insight Derivation**  
   - Analyzed patterns to confirm classical market psychology theories (buy during fear, sell during greed).  
   - Quantified the profitability of trading strategies conditioned on the Fear & Greed Index.

6. **Strategy Suggestion**  
   - Proposed a real-world trading strategy leveraging sentiment data to time market entries and exits for improved returns.

All analysis and visualizations were implemented using Python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn within Jupyter notebooks.

## üìù Key Insights

### 1. **Summary Table: PnL and Trade Volume**
```python
# Code used:
trade_volume = cleaned_df.groupby(['sentiment', 'Side'])['Size USD'].sum().unstack(fill_value=0)
trade_count = cleaned_df.groupby(['sentiment', 'Side']).size().unstack(fill_value=0)
avg_pnl = cleaned_df.groupby(['sentiment', 'Side'])['Closed PnL'].mean().unstack(fill_value=0)
summary = pd.concat([
    trade_count.add_prefix('TradeCount_'),
    trade_volume.add_prefix('TradeVolume_'),
    avg_pnl.add_prefix('AvgPnL_')
], axis=1).round(2)
print(summary)
```

### 2. **Heatmap of Average PnL: Side vs Sentiment**
![Avg PnL by Side and Sentiment](images/heatmap.png)

This chart reveals critical behavior patterns:

- In **Extreme Greed**, **SELL** trades vastly outperform **BUY** trades (Avg PnL: 65.24 vs 7.83)
- In **Fear**, **BUY** trades are more profitable (63.02 vs 36.49)

This supports contrarian strategies‚Äî**"Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy."**

## Explanation

The table above summarizes trade counts and average profit/loss (PnL) for buy and sell sides across different market sentiments, while the heatmap visualizes the average closed PnL by trade side and sentiment.

- **Extreme Fear:**  
  Buying trades are highly profitable with an average PnL of 57.48, much greater than selling trades at 18.15. This suggests buying during periods of extreme fear can capture significant upside as prices tend to be undervalued.

- **Extreme Greed:**  
  Selling trades yield a higher average PnL (65.24) compared to buying trades (7.83), indicating it is often better to take profits or sell during greed-driven markets before corrections happen.

- **Other Sentiments (Fear, Greed, Neutral):**  
  The differences in PnL between buying and selling sides are less dramatic but generally follow the same trend ‚Äî buying tends to perform better during fearful markets and selling performs better during greedy markets.

The heatmap visually reinforces these findings by showing darker red or blue areas where PnL is higher, helping quickly identify profitable trade types across market moods.

Together, this data supports the classical trading wisdom: **buy low during fear, sell high during greed.**

## Suggested Real-World Trading Strategy

Leverage the Fear & Greed Index as a market timing tool to guide trade entries and exits:

1. **Buy Signal:** When the index signals **Extreme Fear** or **Fear**, prioritize opening buy positions. The market tends to undervalue assets during these periods, increasing potential upside.

2. **Sell Signal:** When the index indicates **Extreme Greed** or **Greed**, consider closing or reducing long positions and/or opening sell positions. Market exuberance often precedes corrections.

3. **Neutral Periods:** Use additional indicators or avoid heavy trading to reduce risk during neutral sentiment phases.

This approach, supported by historical data analysis, aligns with behavioral finance principles and aims to capitalize on crowd emotions in crypto markets.

## ‚≠ê Why This Matters

Understanding sentiment-based trading behavior enables firms to build **smarter strategies**, avoid **herd psychology**, and profit from **emotional extremes** in the market. This project proves how **data-driven emotion analysis** can offer a measurable trading edge.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how integrating trader behavior data with market sentiment indexes can provide actionable insights. The validation of the Fear & Greed Index strategy through quantitative analysis equips traders and analysts with a data-driven framework for smarter decision making in volatile crypto markets.
